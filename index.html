            <p>This website was created on 19/7/2021 by Daniel6996-arch.</p>
            <p>It comprises some of my favorite fish flies photographs.</p>
            <p>Fish flies are handcrafted baits used to hook fish. They looked like insects thus the name "fish flies". When crafted by experts, they display no obvious difference from live insects.</p>
